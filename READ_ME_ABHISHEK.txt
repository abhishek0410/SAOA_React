This read me contains the details about how the folders are organised/named . 

1.)counter-app is covered under the lecture headings "Component"  , but we would name it "counter_app" to make it 
in line with mosh - website.

2.)The folder Starter code contains files that mosh uses in building the "vidly app".(See "3-components"-Lecture 15)

3.)"Vidly_copy_2" exists because we could not revert "Vidly_copy" to an earlier commit.
